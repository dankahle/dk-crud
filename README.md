# dk-crud
this project is a simple crud application, first implemented in rest (master branch), and then graphql (graphql branch). So to load all packages, switch to graphql branch, then npm install. An attempt is made to combine rest and graphql in one server, may stay this way, may implement separately as the pattern mean.io uses for rest is suspect:  
router >> repo where we'd like router >> business >> repo(model) instead
