### dk-crud - restql branch
this branch simply morphs the rest api to issue the same parameters to the repository as graphql does in graphql branch in an effort to show how a rest api and graphql endpoint could share the same repo. Not much work there, just passing an object with parameters (how graphql does it) instead of just the parameters. graphql branch does the same and can be tested via postman, this branch simply verifies the UI works with it as well.
