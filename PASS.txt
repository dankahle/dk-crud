* when done with ql version, need to copy the repo back to rest version to verify all works fine both ways, i..e you're looking for a repo solution that works for both right?


pass:
compiler errors done. Now
1. test iwth graphiql
2. when that works, do  below... rest and restql branches and test restql branch crud with ui

pass:
you' just updated repo to handle both rest and ql for getall and getone. these funcitons are looking param objects in ql so we're converting to the same for rest.

you're working on queries section of user schema, then move to mutations... then hit with graphiql, then onto apollo.

BUT FIRST... when you get the repo updated... take it over to master and see if it works, if so, commit that I guess cause i'ts your new master approach? No... make a new branch... so branch master to rest, then branch off that and update repo and update repo and call rest-ql, then you'll have standard rest and ql rest and make sure restql works before moving on with the shared repo thing.
